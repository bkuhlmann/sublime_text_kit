= Sublime Text Kit

Sublime Text Kit is a command line interface for managing Sublime Text metadata for multiple
projects, sessions, snippets, etc. This allows you to avoiding manual maintenance of your workspace
so you can stay focused on your own work.

toc::[]

== Features

* Manages project metadata (`.sublime-project` and `.sublime-workspace` files).
* Manages session metadata so you can quickly toggle between projects via the `CONTROL+COMMAND+p`
  shortcut.
* Prints all of your custom snippets in either link:https://asciidoctor.org[ASCII Doc] or
  link:https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown[Markdown] format.

== Requirements

. link:https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby]
. link:https://www.sublimetext.com[Sublime Text]

== Setup

To install, run:

[source,bash]
----
gem install sublime_text_kit
----

== Usage

=== Command Line Interface (CLI)

From the command line, type: `sublime_text_kit`

....
USAGE:
  -c, --config ACTION                      Manage gem configuration. Actions: edit or view.
  -h, --help                               Show this message.
  -m, --metadata ACTION                    Manage project metadata. Actions: create, delete, or recreate.
  -S, --session                            Rebuild session metadata.
  -s, --snippets [FORMAT]                  View snippets. Formats: markdown or ascii_doc. Default: ascii_doc.
  -u, --update                             Update project and session metadata based on current settings.
  -v, --version                            Show gem version.
....

=== Customization

This gem can be configured via a global configuration:
`~/.config/sublime_text_kit/configuration.yml`. It can also be configured via
link:https://www.alchemists.io/projects/xdg[XDG] environment variables.

An example configuration could be:

[source,yaml]
----
:project_roots:
  - "~/Engineering/Organizations"
  - "~/Engineering/OSS"
:metadata_dir: "~/Dropbox/Cache/Sublime"
:snippets_format: :markdown
----

Feel free to take this configuration, modify, and save as your own.

The `project_roots` key defines the root level directories where your project folders are located.
When project metadata (i.e. `.sublime-project`, `.sublime-workspace`) is generated, the name of the
metadata file will be the same name as the project folder. All project metadata, regardless of root
location, is written to the same metadata directory as defined by the `metadata_dir` key. If using
the example settings shown above and assuming the following directory structure existsâ€¦

....
~/Engineering/OSS/example
~/Engineering/OSS/sublime_text_kit
....

...project metadata will be created in the `metadata_dir` as follows:

....
~/Dropbox/Cache/Sublime/example.sublime-project
~/Dropbox/Cache/Sublime/example.sublime-workspace
~/Dropbox/Cache/Sublime/sublime_text_kit.sublime-project
~/Dropbox/Cache/Sublime/sublime_text_kit.sublime-workspace
....

The `snippets_format` key allows you define what format to print your snippets as. You can always
override your default configuration by specifying the format from the command line:
`sublime_text_kit -s ascii_doc`. For example, this is how
link:https://www.alchemists.io/projects/sublime_text_setup/#_snippets[snippets documentation] is
generated for the link:https://www.alchemists.io/projects/sublime_text_setup[Sublime Text Setup]
project.

=== Workflow

The following demonstrates a default Sublime Text setup:

1. Start by defining your configuration: `sublime_text_kit --config edit`.
2. Shutdown Sublime Text (i.e.Â `COMMAND+q`).
3. Run `sublime_text_kit --update` which will create project metadata and rebuild session metadata
   so Sublime Text has a complete project history from which to switch between via the
   `CONTROL+COMMMAND+p` shortcut.
4. Launch Sublime Text and use the `CONTROL+COMMAND+p` keyboard shortcut to toggle between projects.
   Notice that you can (fuzzy type) project names to jump between them.
5. Navigate through your project workload with ease. ðŸŽ‰

=== Troubleshooting

* When rebuilding your session, ensure Sublime Text is shut down or changes might not be applied
  properly.
* When rebuilding project metadata, ensure the `metadata_dir` -- as defined via your configuration
  -- points to an existing directory which can contain `.sublime-project` and `.sublime-workspace`
  files.
